### **5.5 Integration & Testing** ✅
- [x] Hook system integrated with main connector
- [x] Built-in hooks automatically registered
- [x] Comprehensive test script created
- [x] Package exports updated and organized
- [x] Mock testing for all hook scenarios

**Files Updated:**
- `src/connector.py` - Updated to use new hook system
- `src/__init__.py` - Added hook and observability exports
- `test_phase5.py` - Comprehensive Phase 5 testing

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 6

**Phase 6 Focus**: Main Connector Implementation (Week 11-12)

**Prerequisites Met:**
- ✅ Authentication system complete
- ✅ Transport layer implemented
- ✅ Resilience components (retry, rate limiting, circuit breaker) ready
- ✅ Pagination system with data handling complete
- ✅ Hook system with observability complete
- ✅ Error handling foundation complete
- ✅ Configuration system ready

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement core connector methods (initialize, connect, disconnect, isConnected)
2. Implement request handling with hook integration
3. Implement response wrapping and metadata
4. Implement pagination integration
5. Final testing and validation
