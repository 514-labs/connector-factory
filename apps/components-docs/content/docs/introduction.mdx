# Our thesis

Connectors are the building blocks to all data-intensive applications.
Everyone hates creating them and the only thing worst than creating
them is maintaining them.

Connector providers have taken advantage of this by creating opaque,
expensive connectors that you pay for but never actually own.

It&apos;s time to change that.

What the connector factory is:

- rock solid set of absractions and connector implementation patterns
- prompts and tools to build & test connectors &quot;yourself&quot;
- tools to distribute those connectors, integrate them directly in
  your applications and share them with your friends
