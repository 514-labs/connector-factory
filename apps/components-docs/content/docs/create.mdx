# Create your own connector

Follow these steps to create your own connector:

## 1. Clone the repository
Clone the connector factory repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/514-labs/connector-factory.git
cd connector-factory
```

## 2. Generate a connector scaffold
From the connector factory directory, run the install script to generate a new connector with the appropriate structure:

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://connectors.514.ai/install.sh) [connector-name] [version] [author] [language]
```

Example:
```bash
bash -i <(curl https://connectors.514.ai/install.sh) ads-b-dot-lol v2 fiveonefour typescript
```

This creates a new directory with your connector scaffold in the chosen language.

## 3. Determine your connector type
Identify which type of connector you're building:

- **API Connector**: For general REST/GraphQL APIs
- **SaaS Connector**: For third-party SaaS platforms and services
- **Database Connector**: For SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Blob Storage Connector**: For cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)

## 4. Follow the specifications
Feed your LLM the relevant specifications and documentation:

- **Target API documentation**: Share the official API docs of the service you're connecting to (e.g., Stripe API docs, Shopify API docs)
- **Type-specific specs**: Include the appropriate specification:
  - API Connector Spec for general REST/GraphQL APIs
  - SaaS Connector Spec for third-party SaaS platforms
  - Database Connector Spec for SQL databases
  - Blob Storage Connector Spec for cloud storage
- **Example connectors**: Reference existing connectors in the registry for patterns
  - API Connectors: ADS-B.lol, OpenWeather
  - SaaS Connectors: Google Analytics, Shopify
  - [coming soon] Database Connectors: PostgreSQL
  - [coming soon] Blob Storage Connectors: S3

Your LLM can then help generate the connector implementation following the established patterns and specifications.

## 5. Share your connector
Open a pull request to the connector-factory repository to share your connector with the community. Mention the connector Issue in the PR description.

If you built your connector outside the connector-factory monorepo, you'll need to add it to the monorepo's registry directory with all required metadata (defined in registry/_scaffold).

## Using Claude Code

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), we've encoded our learnings from building connectors into specialized AI agents in the `.claude` directory of this repository. You can prompt Claude Code with:

```
Here's the API documentation: [paste docs URL or attach file]
My API token environment variable is: MY_API_KEY
Please review .claude/README.md, .claude/agents, [appropriate specification from apps/components-docs/content/docs/specifications/], and registry/_scaffold/.
Build me a complete [API_NAME] connector following the patterns.
```

**Note:** Replace `[appropriate specification]` with the relevant spec for your connector type:
- `api-connector.mdx` for REST/GraphQL APIs
- Other specs as they become available for SaaS, Database, and Blob Storage connectors

The agents will handle schema generation, client implementation, testing, and documentation using proven patterns from our OpenWeather, HubSpot, Shopify, and ADS-B implementations.
