# Python Shopify Connector

A production-ready, read-only Python connector for Shopify that adheres to our [API Connector Specification](../api-connector.mdx). This connector provides a standardized interface for extracting data from Shopify stores with built-in resilience, rate limiting, and pagination.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from shopify_connector import ShopifyConnector

# Initialize and connect
connector = ShopifyConnector({
    "shop": "your-store.myshopify.com",
    "apiVersion": "2024-07",
    "accessToken": "your-admin-api-token"
})

connector.connect()

# Extract data
products = connector.get('/products')
orders = connector.paginate('/orders')

connector.disconnect()
```
